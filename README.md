a random audio visualizer i made

# science
i get a lot of background noise so the bass would always be high and i didnt really mind it<br>
but this time, when i touched my computer, the bass would stabilize to nothing<br>
or when i brought my mic closer to my computer<br>
idk but i just wanted to say that, and yeah<br>
